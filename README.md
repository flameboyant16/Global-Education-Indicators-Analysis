# Global Education Metrics Dashboard

## Overview
This project contains an Excel dashboard analyzing global education data for 2023. The dashboard provides insights on literacy rates, internet access, average years of schooling, GDP per capita, and population across various countries and regions.

## Data Cleaning
- Standardized country and region names.
- Removed special characters from numeric fields (%,$, USD).
- Converted text numbers to numeric values.
- Handled missing data and removed summary rows.

## Analysis & Visualizations
- Created summary tables and PivotTables to answer key questions:
  - Average literacy rate per region.
  - Countries with highest and lowest internet access.
  - Population totals for countries below 80% literacy.
  - Region with highest average GDP per capita.
- Visualized data with bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and map charts.
- Built an interactive Excel dashboard with slicers for region and country filtering.

## How to Use
